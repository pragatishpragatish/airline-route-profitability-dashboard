# ✈️ Airline Route Profitability Dashboard

This project is an interactive business intelligence dashboard that analyzes airline route performance using key metrics like profitability, load factor, ticket price, and customer churn.

## 📌 Project Summary

The dashboard helps visualize airline route profitability using filters like route, booking class, frequent flyer status, and more. Built as a **portfolio project** to demonstrate data cleaning, KPI calculation, and dashboard design — inspired by real-world commercial airline operations.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Power BI** — Dashboard creation, KPI cards, slicers, charts
- **Python (Pandas, Haversine)** — Data cleaning, distance calculation, KPI logic
- **Excel** — Optional quick checks and formatting
- **GitHub** — Version control and project hosting

## 📊 Key Features

- **Profitability by Route**: See which routes perform best
- **Load Factor & Delay Metrics**: Operational efficiency insight
- **Customer Churn Analysis**: Loyalty and retention segmentation
- **Filters**: Booking Class, Frequent Flyer Status, Departure Date, and Churn
- **Time Series**: Revenue and profitability trends over time

## 🧠 Industry Relevance

This project simulates real airline analytics — similar to use cases at companies like **Sabre**, **Amadeus**, or major airlines. It reflects how data is used to:

- Optimize route networks
- Analyze load factors and costs
- Understand customer loyalty and churn
- Improve yield management strategies

## ⚠️ Data Notes

- This dataset is **simulated** and used only for educational/portfolio purposes.
- Base data is adapted from publicly available airline datasets and synthetic customer records.
